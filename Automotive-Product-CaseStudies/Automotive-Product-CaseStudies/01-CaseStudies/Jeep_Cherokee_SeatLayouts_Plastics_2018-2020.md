# Case Study: Jeep Cherokee — Seat Layouts & Plastics (2018–2020)

## Context
Global SUV program requiring cohesive seat layouts balancing **comfort, packaging and safety** while conforming to strict OEM design standards.

## Role
**Design Engineer (Foam + Plastics)** — Magna Seating ESI, Pune, India.

## Responsibilities (Engineering + Early PM Exposure)
- Developed complete seat layouts; ensured alignment with OEM specs and design standards.
- Modeled **A‑face & B‑side foam** components; achieved **~95% first‑time approval** via precision surfacing and structural compliance.
- Designed plastic parts (e.g., **clock spring & track covers**) in **CATIA V5**; improved surface quality, **reducing iteration cycles by ~25%**.
- **Collaborated with cross‑functional teams** to translate OEM requirements into user‑centric designs; **reduced revisions by ~30%** and aligned with product lifecycle goals.
- **Participated in Agile workflows** (backlog grooming, sprint planning, MVP scoping); ensured feature prioritization based on stakeholder alignment and measurable criteria.

## Tools & Methods
CATIA V5, UG NX, Teamcenter, **Jira**, **Miro**, **Figma**, Trello, Microsoft Office; GD&T, DFMEA.

## Standards & Compliance
Tracked requirements and changes in **Teamcenter** with references to **ECE, FMVSS, Euro NCAP** where applicable.

## Artifacts & Templates
- PRD outline & backlog: see `../02-Templates/PRD-Template.md` and `../02-Templates/Backlog-Template.md`
- Roadmap & checklist: see `../02-Templates/Product-Roadmap-Sample.md` and `../02-Templates/Design-Review-Checklist.md`

## Measurable Outcomes
- ~95% first‑time approvals on foam designs.
- ~25% fewer iteration cycles on plastics due to improved surfacing quality.
- ~30% reduction in revisions by integrating stakeholder feedback early.

## Lessons
- Interface ownership + early packaging agreements avoid late churn.
- Small Agile rituals (clear backlog, BLUF updates) improved decision speed.
